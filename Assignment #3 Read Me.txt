Password Strength Analysis
Overview
This source code analyses password strength using a dataset of 10,000 randomly generated passwords. The goal is to identify what makes a password strong, focusing on factors like length and the inclusion of special characters.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Attributes:
Password: The password itself
Length: Number of characters
Uppercase: Whether it contains uppercase letters
Lowercase: Whether it contains lowercase letters
Numbers: Whether it contains numbers
Special Characters: Whether it contains special characters
Strength: Labeled as 'Weak,' 'Medium,' or 'Strong'
Figures/Graphs
The analysis generates several figures, including:

Password Strength Distribution
Password Length Distribution
Histogram of Password Lengths with Quartiles
Box Plot of Password Lengths by Strength
Scatter Plot of Password Length and Strength
Bar Charts and Pie Charts for Character Types
Statistical Test Results (T-Tests, Chi-Square)

Requirements

Run the script.

Upload the file "passwords_dataset.CSV" when prompted.

The script will execute and generate graphs/plots.
